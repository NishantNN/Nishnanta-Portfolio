             <p> <h1>Personal info</h1></p><br>
            <p>Greetings, I am Nishanta Poudel. My name may pose pronunciation challenges, particularly for those unfamiliar with Nepali names. However, you can simply refer to me as Nishanta, which should prove easier. Allow me to introduce myself. </p><br>
            <p>In terms of appearance, I am a fair-skinned individual with a slight beard and occasionally, I wear spectacles. I stand at an average height of approximately 5 feet 5 inches. At 18 years of age, I am a young man with a generally reserved demeanor. Initially, you may find me less talkative, but once we establish a rapport, you'll discover me to be a talkative and open-minded individual. </p><br>
            <p>I hail from eastern Nepal, specifically from the town of 'Nayabazar,' nestled in the picturesque Ilam district—one of Nepal's most beautiful regions. This small town is perched at an elevation of around 2000 meters above sea level, holding a treasure trove of cherished childhood memories. </p><br>
            <p>My family comprises four members: my father, Baba; my mother, Aama; my sister, Didi; and myself. I do not exaggerate when I say that my father is an incredibly kind and humble man, a true role model, and my guiding light. He is a teacher by profession, dedicating more than 30 years to the noble cause of education. I feel blessed to have his guidance and aspire to be a positive influence in society, just as he is. </p><br>
            <p>My mother, a homemaker, manages the household with grace and kindness. Her inner and outer beauty is unparalleled in my eyes. She radiates warmth and kindness to everyone. To me, my parents are akin to living gods, a sentiment captured in the saying, "God cannot be everywhere, so He created parents for all." </p><br>
            <p>Now, let me introduce my passions, hobbies, and interests. First and foremost, I have a deep passion for physics, which I hope to delve into extensively in the future. During my school days, I used to watch animated physics videos, realizing my fervent passion for learning and visualizing these captivating concepts. I am particularly enthralled by Einstein's general and special theories of relativity, which encompass fascinating notions such as time dilation, the curvature of spacetime, and the photoelectric effect. To me, physics serves as the language of the universe, with mathematics as its script.</p><br>
            <p>Secondly, I must mention my passion for cars and motorbikes. These remarkable machines on wheels have always captured my attention. One of the most appealing two-wheeled beasts is the Bajaj NS 200. When it comes to cars, the Tesla Model S Plaid, adorned in commanding black, has left an indelible impression on me. The power emanating from the gas pedal or throttle is truly exhilarating.</p><br>
            <p>Moving on, I have a fascination with the Rubik's Cube. While many perceive it as a mere toy, it is far more than that. An average 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube boasts a staggering 43 quintillion possible combinations, a figure that may seem astonishing, but it is a result of intricate permutations. I learned to solve this puzzle during my school days, achieving an average solving time of less than a minute. I delved into the major algorithms required for this intricate craft, dedicating countless hours to mastering it.</p><br>
            <p>As for my hobbies, coding holds a special place in my heart. I received my first laptop during my ninth-grade studies, a moment I vividly remember. I eagerly explored this technological marvel, diving deep into what I deemed an "amazing piece of tech." My enthusiasm led me to create my first portfolio website by the end of my tenth-grade year.</p><br>
            <p>Lastly, I have a profound attachment to music. I thoroughly enjoy listening to a wide range of music, from timeless classics to modern English songs. Music has been an integral part of my life, and I own a set of earpods that accompany me on my musical journeys. I tend to choose music that resonates with my current mood.</p><br>
            <p>In conclusion, this provides a glimpse into who I am as an individual. If you've read this far, I extend my gratitude. Remember, always spread love. <br>

                <p> <h1>Academics</h1></p><br>
                    <p>Let's delve into my academic journey. Initially, I wasn't an exceptionally brilliant student, at least not until grade V. However, as time progressed, so did my overall academic performance. I have successfully completed my 12th grade, and I'm content with the results I've achieved thus far. Looking ahead, my aspiration is to pursue my undergraduate degree in AI engineering outside of Nepal. My foremost choice has always been the United States due to my profound admiration for its education system. I yearn to immerse myself in the realm of engineering, particularly within the United States.</p><br>
                    <p>My educational odyssey began with my early years at Gyanbigyan Sikshya Sadan, an elementary school, where I completed my KG and grade 1. Subsequently, I continued my education at Ilam Shuvakanya English School, progressing until grade 8. At the age of 10, I ventured into district-level examinations, achieving a commendable percentage of 86.43 in my grade 5 exams conducted by PABSON-Nepal in 2072 BS/2016 AD.Next, I got a GPA of 3.96 in my grade 8 local level examination conducted by Maijogmai Rural-Municipality in 2075 BS/2019 AD.</p><br>
                    <p>My educational journey continued as I transitioned to Shree Amarkalyan Secondary School, a government-owned institution, where I pursued my 9th and 10th grades. In grade 9, I attained a GPA of 3.85 in the annual examination conducted by the school. In the culmination of my high school years, I achieved a perfect GPA of 4.0 in my grade 10 national level examination conducted by the National Examinations Board (NEB) in 2077 BS/2021 AD.</p><br>                    
                    <p>For my 11th and 12th grades, I attended Kanchanjunga English High School, specializing in the science stream. In grade 11, I secured a GPA of 3.72. Similarly, in the final stretch of my high school journey, I earned a GPA of 3.63 in my grade 12 national level board examinations conducted by NEB in 2080 BS/2023 AD.</p><br>                    
                    <p>Presently, I am actively preparing for the IELTS and SAT tests, aiming to meet the eligibility criteria for studying in the United States. My dream is to further my education in AI engineering, and I am committed to taking the necessary steps to achieve this goal.</p><br>

            <div class="eca">
            <p><h1>ECA & Leadership</h1></p><br>
            <p>Let’s talk about my ECA and leadership. It was back in grade 6 in the morning school assembly: our school captain was absent and there was no one to conduct the assembly. Our then principal (Indra Dhungel-Ilam Shuvakanya English School) was walking along the rows of students. Out of nowhere, I saw his eyes staring at me and suddenly I saw him signaling me to come in front of the assembly. I was confused if it was me whom he wanted to come in front. I walked with a bit of nervousness and stood in front of him with hands in my back and a low face. He then said, “You shall conduct today’s assembly.” I got even more nervous at that point but somewhere deep inside I was also excited about the responsibility I was given. I conducted the assembly the best I could. I was excited to share my experience to my friends after the assembly. Our school only had classes up to grade 8. Our previous school captain (Sandesh Khatiwada) was a student of grade 8 and was soon going to have a farewell from the school. So there was a new recruitment for the new school captain. He was our school captain for 3 straight years. The farewell for grade 8 was just about to come. One day, principal sir called me and said that he was satisfied with my loud and sharp voice and he wanted me as the new school captain. Deep inside my heart, I was extremely proud of myself. I also felt the sense of responsibility of what I was about to be given. Soon I was the new school captain at the end of grade 6. I started conducting the morning assembly every day. I gave speech topics to many students which they had to prepare and deliver in the next day’s morning assembly. I, myself, gave lots and lots of speech in the morning assembly as well. I was given many other responsibilities too. This is how my journey began in developing my leadership skills. I was exposed to speak in front of people in an early age. I participated in multiple different competitions on speaking in the public, essay writing, quiz and so on. I was well at both academics and sports. Every Friday, we had sports session after the lunch break. I facilitated and participated in lots of those sessions. The days of our farewell also soon came and we, students of then grade 8, collected funds with some support from teachers to organize a farewell program for ourselves. I was given duty to manage all the events and to host the program as well. The program was a huge achievement and my teachers admired me as well as all my friends for our effort. Then, it was an end of a beautiful chapter from that school.</p><br>
            <p>I then got myself admitted for grade 9 and 10 in Shree Amarkalyan Secondary School. It was a governmental school of roughly 800-1000 students from kinder garden to grade 12. There, a student had to conduct the assembly for a week and pass the role to another at the end of the week. The got to know about my leadership abilities and I was frequently called to host the morning assembly in this school as well. Not just that, there was also a Children’s club named, “Shreejansheel Children’s Club” in the school. I got a chance to be the Co-coordinator of the club. We hosted club meeting in the weekend of every month and discussed our plans for next week. We conducted various cleanliness and cultural programs and various other activities in our tenure. We introduced weekly poster featuring creativity like art, essay, poem etc. of students every week in the school’s notice board. Also, we got an opportunity to be on a training session where students of various schools in our ward had participated. It was a training session for good hygiene and cleanliness. There, we decided to make an ally of all schools of our ward under the name, “Pragatisheel Children’s Association.” I was elected as the president for the association. Karuna Foundation helped our association financially and in multiple other ways. Under the financial support of Karuna Foundation, we decided to organize an, “Interschool speech competition” in the auspicious occasion of, “National Children’s Day.” We organized a rally where the students of nearby schools were present too. The rally then converted into an official program under my chairmanship. This program was hosted in our own school. Guests like ward chairman, president of school management committee, school principal were present in our program. I wanted to host the program too. So I told my host friend to host the official part of the program. As a chairman, I’d end the official part of the program and host the speech competition as un-official part. In this way, I hosted the program too. I got a chance to participate in essay writing competition hosted by Shree Himalaya SS in a different municipality. At first, our school conducted a competition in our school and the winner had a chance to participate in the program. I got in the first place and got a chance to represent my school in the program. I went there with our computer teacher Udaya Bhattrai. I secured a third position there. I too acted as a volunteer for a quiz competition organized by Balaguru Children’s Club. I have also participated in a session of Reproductive Health and abortion education organized by IPAS Nepal in district headquarters where two students of every public school of the district were present. I’ve been awarded with five different certificates in the school annual programming for volunteering, march-past, and track and field events like relay, running and volleyball. I was honored with the student of the batch for securing the best out of roughly 100 students in grade 10. I too got honored consecutively for being the best student of entire school which is the most prestigious award of my school. Then my days of departure soon arrived and I had to say goodbye to my high school too. </p><br>
            <p>I went away from my hometown to persuade my +2 studies in a different district in Kanchanjunga Namuna Secondary School/College. I joined the science stream there. I earned a certificate there too for volleyball in the annual program organized by the college. </p><br>
            <p>Apart from school, I’ve earned two certificates from Google about Digital marketing and Introduction to generative AI which I took from Google Digital Garage and Coursera respectively. I too took a small online course about Emergency Preparedness and Response from UNICEF. I have deep interests in web development as I’ve been learning web development since grade 10 and I’ve hosted this current website too. I also am learning Python through online resources like YouTube that will help me in my undergrad journey too, I suppose.</p><br>
